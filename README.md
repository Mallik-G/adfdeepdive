Resources for the Azure Data Factory Deep Dive Workshop

# Prerequisites
Most modern laptops should be sufficient for completing the labs, but you will want to ensure you have the latest [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017) or [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download?view=sql-server-2017), as well as [SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt?view=sql-server-2017) installed locally).

[Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer) will be helpful as well

Optionally you might want to install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download#) As well

I recomend the Following add-in's For working with PowerShell and ARM Templates:

[PowerShell VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell)

[Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools)

[Azure Resource Manager Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samcogan.arm-snippets)



I've put together the following prerequisites document to help guide you through the process. It looks long since the instructions are detailed, but it shouldn't take more than 60 minutes:

**NOTE:** Please complete the prerequisites before the workshop. Due to the number of attendees, we won't have time to walk through these steps in depth during the workshop. If you encounter any issues during the course of setup, please feel free to [email me](jason@jasonhorner.com) for help.
